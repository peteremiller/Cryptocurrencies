# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of Project
In this project I am working with Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, on of my most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data Martha and I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it is decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We’ll use data visualizations to share findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.

## Results: Created Four Deliverables
### Deliverable 1: Process the Data for PCA

### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
